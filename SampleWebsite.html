<h1> LAB 1: INTRODUCTION TO EQUIPMENTS </h1>
<h2> OUTLINE: </h2>
<p>Familiarizing with the use of the digital multimeter, oscilloscope, function generator and DC power supply by measuring resistances and capacitance of circuit elements <br>
and within own selves and also generating wave functions to given parameters.<br>
<h3><u>1.2 Activity- The Digital Multimeter</u></h3>
Exercise 1:
<i>Description </i>- Measure the resistance and capacitance of the given resistors and capacitors respectively. In addition, measure our body resistance and capacitance.

<li>Do other members in your group have the same colour codes?</li>
No, we had different color codes for the resistors, but except one common per pair. 
<li>Did they measure the same values? </li>
In my case, for R3 I got 894 ohms and my partner who had the exact same color-coded resistor got 895 ohms which are close enough. 
<li>Do the capacitors have markings which identify their values? </li>
For C1 we got a value close to what is marked on the capacitor. On the other hand for C2 we all got the same reading but couldn &apos; t find a marking with a value close to the measured figure.
<li>What is the resistance and capacitance between your left and right hands?</li> 
0.488 nano-Farad is my capacitance.									
4.87 Mega ohms is my resistance, but the reading was unstable and depend on how I touch it and my movements.									
<li>Are resistance or capacitance ever negative?</li>
Resistance and capacitance are always positive.
